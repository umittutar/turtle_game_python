These files is my homeworks. Example codes for python learners. All of these my codes. I think already you understand (:))). At the same time, my English is also at a beginner level. Anyway,  Main theme is 'turtle' and 'tkinter' usage in python. In code rows there are on timer, write, drawing commands, threads and etc commands. From simple to relatively difficult. 
Image and other necessary files in same directory. Please download also that files. For example for "26_CryptoWork_06.py" file also download "labelPict.png"
